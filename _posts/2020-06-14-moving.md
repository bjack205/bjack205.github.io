In a very unexpected turn of events, I'm moving to Pittsburgh! My advsor, Zac Manchester, accepted a faculty position in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University and my wife Alyssa and I decided to follow him. I'm transferring from Stanford to CMU in the fall and will be getting my PhD in Robotics from CMU. This is a huge change, but one we're very excited for. We will definitely miss the wonderful California weather and the beautiful Stanford campus, and, of course, all of the friends we've made in the Bay Area. We'll see what adventures Pennsylvania has in store for us!
