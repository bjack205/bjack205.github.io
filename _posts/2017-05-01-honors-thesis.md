As part of the Honors program during my undergraduate studies at Brigham Young University I had to carry out an extended research project in my field of expertise. My undergraduate research with Dr. David Fullwood focused on developing algorithms for the analysis of electron backsctter diffraction (EBSD) patterns. My Honors Thesis focused on a particular application of these algorithms, and was later published in Applied Crystallography.
