My paper ["Planning with Attitude"](/papers/planning_with_attitude.pdf) that I wrote with Zac and colleague Kevin Tracy got accepted to Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) without any required revisions. The editors gave positive feedback about how well the material was presented and the quality of the writing. Definitely a good thing to hear after the original version we submitted to WAFR got rejected earlier this year.
