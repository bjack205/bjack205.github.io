I presented our ALTRO paper at IROS 2019 in Macau, China. It was my first attending an entire robotics conference. I met a lot of people and had a lot of interesting discussions. My presentation went great, and I felt like we had a lot of people interested in what we were doing. A link to the slides I used for my presentation is included below.
