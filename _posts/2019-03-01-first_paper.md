I submitted my first paper in graduate school! Taylor Howell, Dr. Manchester and I submitted our paper on our novel algorithm for trajectory optimization, ALTRO, to IROS 2019. It feels great to have a paper (finally) out the door and hopefully more to quickly follow. Check out our submission in the link below. Here's a snapshot of ALTRO in action:
