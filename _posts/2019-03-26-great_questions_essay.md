One of my favorite classes during my undergraduate at Brigham Young University was my capstone class to graduate with Honors, titled "Great Questions Essay." For the class, you write a 20-30 page essay about a "great question," or one that doesn't have a definitive answer, and address it from 3 unique disciplines. I decided to investigate how human and artificial intelligence differ. I loved the class so much I was a teaching assistant coaching other students through the process my whole Senior year.
