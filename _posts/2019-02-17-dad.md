On October 21, 2018 my father David Brian Jackson passed away after a 5 month battle with esophogeal cancer. My parents' thoughts on passing through this experience can be found on their [blog](https://davidshealingjourney.blogspot.com/). My father impacted me in so many ways, and was perhaps the biggest reason I decided to study engineering. While losing my father has been hard in many ways, I'm eternally grateful to have had such a wonderful father who taught me to love others, work hard, and always do my best.
