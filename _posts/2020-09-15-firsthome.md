Alyssa and I bought our first home! We definitely didn't see ourselves buying a home after only being married for 2 years, but we also didn't expect to be living in Pittsburgh. Although the process was difficult and exhausting (the pandemic certainly didn't help at all), we're extremely grateful to finally have a place to call home after being homeless for about 3 months. In a time where many people are loosing jobs, loved ones, or struggling financially or emotionally, we realize how fortunate we are to be in a situation to be able to buy our own home.
