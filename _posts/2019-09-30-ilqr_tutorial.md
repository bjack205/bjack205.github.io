A lot of my recent work has been focused on methods for speeding up methods for trajectory optimization. Based off of my recent paper that was accepted to IROS 2019 and some other work, I've put together a tutorial/walkthrough of ALTRO and augmented Lagrangian iLQR (AL-iLQR). Hope this proves helpful to people interested in trajectory optimization. I wish I would have had something like this when I was getting into this a year and half ago!
