I got my Master's Degree in Mechanical Engineering from Stanford University! It feels like less of an accomplishment than it actually is given I still have another 3-4 years left at Stanford and I work on my Doctorate degree. Still, it has been a great past 2 years. I've learned a TON about robotics, control, machine learning, and optimization. I've made some great friends here at Stanford and am incredibly grateful for all the support and encouragement I've received, especially through the hard times of almost dying in a bike accident and my father getting diagnosed with cancer and dying just 5 months later. I especially wouldn't have been able to do it without the support of my sweet wife, Alyssa. We celebrated our first year wedding anniversary one day before I conferred my Masters degree, and I'm so grateful for her support and patience that have helped make it all possible!
